Title: Building a Very-Long-Term Memory Mechanism for Neural Networks: Insights from Machine Learning, Neuroscience, and Mathematics

Abstract: This report summarizes the thoughts of a multi-disciplinary team on the development of a very-long-term memory mechanism for neural networks, with perspectives from machine learning, neuroscience, and mathematics. The complex task of developing such a mechanism could potentially be achieved through combinations of existing machine learning approaches, adopting neurobiological mechanisms responsible for long-term memory in the human brain, and addressing mathematical challenges related to information retention over long sequences.

1. Machine Learning Perspective:

The team's machine learning expert suggested several approaches to building a very-long-term memory mechanism for a neural network. These include the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, memory augmentation, creation of temporal hierarchies, attention mechanisms, sparse representations, regularization techniques, architectural changes, and continual learning. A combination of these approaches, carefully tailored to the specific task, could potentially offer a solution. However, the specifics of implementation would require extensive experimentation and fine-tuning.

2. Neuroscience Perspective:

The neuroscience expert proposed emulating the neurobiological processes responsible for long-term memory in the human brain. This could involve a mechanism similar to LSTMs, designed to mimic the brain's consolidation of long-term memory from the hippocampus to the neocortex. The neural network could be designed to have a "sleep phase," moving information from a temporary storage area to a more permanent one. The network could be programmed to identify and retain frequently accessed or accurate information, discarding less useful information, mirroring the concept of synaptic plasticity in the brain. The team also suggested exploring the role of neuromodulators in memory formation, as an analogous mechanism within the neural network could potentially improve its long-term memory capabilities. 

3. Mathematical Perspective:

The mathematical perspective focused on the design of neural networks in terms of linear transformations and non-linear functions, and how certain networks like RNNs and LSTMs have a kind of 'memory' due to their ability to process input sequences over time. For very-long-term memory, the challenge might be the vanishing gradient problem, where the contribution of information decays geometrically over time. This makes it hard for the network to learn connections between temporally distant events. Designing a network architecture that selectively retains and discards important and unimportant information, respectively, might be a potential solution. However, it would require a deep understanding of not just the mathematics of neural networks, but also the underlying computer science and perhaps even neuroscience.

In conclusion, building a very-long-term memory mechanism for neural networks is a complex task that would potentially benefit from a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating insights from machine learning, neuroscience, and mathematics. More research and experimentation are needed to determine the best combination of these approaches for the task.
